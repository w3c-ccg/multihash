## The Multihash Data Format

This specification describes a data model for expressing the output of
cryptographic hash functions.

Cryptographic hash functions often have multiple output sizes and encodings.
This variability makes it difficult for applications to examine a series of
bytes and determine which hash function produced them. Multihash is a universal
data format for encoding outputs from hash functions. It is useful to write
applications that can simultaneously support different hash function outputs as
well as upgrade their use of hashes over time; Multihash is intended to
address these needs.
